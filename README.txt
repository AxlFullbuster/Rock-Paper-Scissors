This is a simple rock, paper, scissors game. The program will ask you for the amount of rounds you would like to play.
The program will assume that the user enters a number, if anything but a number is entered who knows what will happen,
any input on this would be appreciated. Once the games are finished the program will ask if you would like your scores,
you can accept or decline this request.

If compiling the program gives you a "no such file found" error try this:
g++ 'RPS Game.cpp', if you know how to fix this please let me know.

That's all! I Hope it provides some entertainment.
